## 📐 The Kim Space

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Definition (Kim Space).** A *Kim space* is a 5-tuple $(\mathcal{M}, g, \mathcal{G}, \nabla, \varphi)$ where:
>
> - $\mathcal{M}$ is a **Riemannian manifold** of problems worth solving.
> - $g$ is a **metric** that measures the distance between curiosity and understanding.
> - $\mathcal{G}$ is an **equivariant symmetry group** acting faithfully on $\mathcal{M}$.
> - $\nabla$ is a **connection** that transports ideas across disciplines via parallel transport.
> - $\varphi: \mathcal{M} \times [0,1] \to \mathcal{M}$ is a **diffusion process** such that $\lim_{t \to 1} \varphi(\cdot, t)$ converges to structured solutions.
>
> A Kim space is said to be **complete** if every Cauchy sequence of hard problems admits a limit in $\mathcal{M}$.

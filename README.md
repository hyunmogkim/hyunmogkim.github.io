\begin{definition}[Kim Space]
A \textbf{Kim space} is a 5-tuple $(\mathcal{M}, g, \mathcal{G}, \nabla, \varphi)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{M}$ is a Riemannian manifold of problems worth solving,
    \item $g$ is a metric that measures the distance between curiosity and understanding,
    \item $\mathcal{G}$ is an equivariant symmetry group acting faithfully on $\mathcal{M}$,
    \item $\nabla$ is a connection that transports ideas across disciplines, and
    \item $\varphi: \mathcal{M} \times [0,1] \to \mathcal{M}$ is a diffusion process such that $\lim_{t \to 1} \varphi(\cdot, t)$ converges to structured solutions.
\end{itemize}
A Kim space is said to be \textbf{complete} if every Cauchy sequence of hard problems admits a limit in $\mathcal{M}$.
\end{definition}
